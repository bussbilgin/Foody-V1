Hello there,
This is a personal project that I use to showcase my current progress on Vue.JS.

In this project, I used Vue3 and SASS and followed BEM methodology.<br>
Practiced mobile responsivity and tried to build my folder structure to be scalable.<br>
Project Uses Yelp Fusion API to make searches on Yelp,<br>
Dynamically renders returned businesses.<br>

Regards.
